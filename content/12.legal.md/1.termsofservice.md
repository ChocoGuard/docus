ChocoGuard, often referred to as "the bot," serves as a tool designed to enhance your Discord™ experience, making it more enjoyable and convenient. ChocoGuard functions within a Discord™ guild or server.

Support for ChocoGuard is exclusively available on the support server, and it operates on a 'first-come-first-serve' basis. Any attempts to seek support through other channels are not officially recognized.

### 1.3 - General Information

ChocoGuard is a free service provided without any guarantees. It's in the beta stage, which means it may have some bugs. Your understanding and patience in this regard are greatly appreciated.



## 2.0 - Use of the ChocoGuard Economy System

### 2.1 - Data

By using ChocoGuard commands that involve providing data, you agree that all information will be stored on a remote database indefinitely. This data is highly confidential and will not be used for any purpose other than the specific functionality of the bot. It will not be sold or shared.

### 2.2 - Usage and Cheating/Botting

Cheating and using bots (including self-bots, user-bots, macros, and auto-clickers on your account to gain an unfair advantage) are strictly prohibited. If caught cheating or botting in any currency-related commands, your profile is at high risk of complete deletion from the database without prior warning. [Please note that this violation may also result in a Discord ban, as it goes against Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

#### 2.2.1 - Macros

Keyboard macros are allowed if they perform only one command per keypress. For example, having a macro to execute `/beg` and then pressing enter is acceptable. However, running a macro that performs multiple commands with a single keypress, such as "claim daily -> enter -> claim weekly -> enter -> beg," is considered botting and is not allowed.

### 2.3 - Re-incidences

**Continued cheating on the games or currency commands will lead to the **termination of your account**, with all its **data deleted**, and a **blacklist** from using the bot.**
