# FAQ

## 0.0 - Why do we use Slash Commands?
The move to slash commands from prefix commands is something being enforced by Discord on verified bots. Bots who aren't verified still use Slash/Prefix commands  today, but it is highly recommended to use Slash Commands to stay up-to-date with the new version of Discord.JS. They also seek to make it easier for users to find and use commands.

For more information, check out Discord's [Slash Commands FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) or their [Blog Post](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-are-here).

## 1.0 - The bot is not responding or lagging what do I do?
There really isn't much that you can do besides wait. We will usually announce issues within this guild as soon as we become aware of them. In most cases this is just a temporary hiccup within discord and should resolve itself.

## 2.0 - What do the money/items within ChocoGuard do? How to earn credits? What is the purpose?
We have this well explained and detailed wiki explaining every questions you might have! Simply visit our [Curreny-101 Page](https://www.chocoguard.xyz/api/eco-account).

## 2.1 - Willl I be able to spawn in money/items?
Answer is **NO**, you will be not able to as in Developers of ChocoGuard are also not capable of doing that, allowing you to summon money or items from nowhere could tip over the economy.

## 3.0 - What is /search-blacklist? How to use it? What purpose does it have?
SOON

## 4.0 - ChocoGuard has deleted all my roles/channels/banned all my user?
::list{type="info"}

Before blaming anything on us you need to make sure if it was the **real ChocoGuard**. To identify the real one you check one of 3 things, though it is best to check them all.
::list{type="success"}
- Check if the Username is exactly the same, no weird letters, no upper or lowercases like ChOcoGuard.
- Check if the discriminator (numbers after the # in the username) is **7427**
- Check if the ID of ChocoGuard matches with this ID: `1087656468108562442`

If none of the mentioned signs match, it's likely that you've encountered a fake ChocoGuard bot. We understand how frustrating this can be, but unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about it. To help combat this issue, we strongly encourage you to report it to the Trust and Safety team. The more evidence you can provide, the better.

For your safety, never invite a bot labeled "ChocoGuard" if any of the mentioned warning signs are present. A genuine invite will always redirect you to this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=213466096718708737&scope=bot%20application.commands and may include permission settings as needed. Stay vigilant and protect your server from imposters.
