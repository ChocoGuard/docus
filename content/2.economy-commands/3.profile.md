# Profile (Ranks, Inventory, Etc...)

The "Profile" command is a feature in your Discord bot or application that allows users to check their own or someone else's profile information, including their balance, inventory, cooldowns, and rank. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the "Profile" command.


## Command Usage:
The command can be executed by typing `/profile` followed by optional parameters:
- [user]: Mention a user (e.g., @username) to check their profile. If not specified, the command will display the user's own profile.
- [page]: An integer that specifies the page number for inventory pagination (optional). Defaults to page 1 if not provided.
