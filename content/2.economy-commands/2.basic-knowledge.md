## Deposit Money

**After creating your account** in ChocoGuard using `/eco-account`, If you wish to save your money, you can use the `/deposit` command. This allows you to securely place your funds into your bank, ensuring they are safe and potentially earning interest. By using this command, you can start building your wealth and making strategic financial decisions within the ChocoGuard eco-system.

## Account Deletion

If you ever wish to delete your ChocoGuard account, the process is just as easy. Use the command `/delete-account``, and your account will be promptly removed. Please note that upon successful account deletion, your wallet/bank/items/etc... will be removed, as it's tied to your account. So, if you decide to close your account, make sure you're aware that any remaining funds will be forfeited.
