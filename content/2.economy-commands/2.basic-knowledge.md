# Basic Knowledge

In this page we seek to cover the most basic commands to get you started with the currency system.



## Account Creation

In ChocoGuard, we've made it straightforward to get started by creating your account. Simply use the command `/eco-account`, and you'll instantly set up your account. **As a welcome gift**, we'll **deposit $500 into your wallet**, giving you a solid financial foundation to begin your journey within our eco-system. This initial balance allows you to dive into our features and enjoy all that ChocoGuard has to offer right from the start.

## Deposit Money

**After creating your account** in ChocoGuard using `/eco-account`, If you wish to save your money, you can use the `/deposit` command. This allows you to securely place your funds into your bank, ensuring they are safe and potentially earning interest. By using this command, you can start building your wealth and making strategic financial decisions within the ChocoGuard eco-system.

## Account Deletion

If you ever wish to delete your ChocoGuard account, the process is just as easy. Use the command `/delete-account``, and your account will be promptly removed. Please note that upon successful account deletion, your wallet/bank/items/etc... will be removed, as it's tied to your account. So, if you decide to close your account, make sure you're aware that any remaining funds will be forfeited.

## Ways of Collecting Money

### Begging

The `/beg` command in ChocoGuard allows you to try your luck by begging. When you use this command, you have a **chance** to **receive money** or even a **cookie as a reward**. However, please be aware that there's also a possibility that your begging attempt might **NOT** be successful and could result in a **deduction** from your current wallet.

::list{type="info"}
- /Beg has chances of Earning money, Losing money or Getting a cookie as reward.

### Work

The `/work` command in ChocoGuard is quite similar to the `/job [jobs]` command, but with a subtle difference. While both commands relate to employment within the ChocoGuard community, `/work` is the command you use to actually perform the job you previously chose. Once you've secured a job through `/job [jobs]`, you can activate your chosen position and start working by using `/work`. This command allows you to engage in the tasks and responsibilities associated with your job, helping you earn rewards, money, or other benefits based on your performance.



## Profile instead of Balance

Your profile is your main point in the Economy System. It will display your items, your balance and a bunch more.

## Tools - Where to start?

The commands you've just learned with are a good starting point, but they won't enough for what lies ahead. To prepare for what's coming, the next essential knowledge is about tools. In ChocoGuard, a variety of tools are at your disposal, each with different tiers and capabilities. However, for now, we'll concentrate on the three fundamental tools that form the building blocks of your journey: `Pickaxe`, `Hunting Rifle`,  and `Lockpick`.

These 3 basic tools are always available for you to buy at the market. As you progress you will be able to create better tools.

### Durability [SOON?]

### Mine

**Required Tool: Pickaxe**

When you execute the `/mine` command, you go on a mining adventure to collect resources and potentially discover valuable items. A higher-tier pickaxe yields more resources and increases your likelihood of unearthing epic items. Keep in mind that certain items are exclusive to specific tool qualities.
Take a look at our [Item Documentation Page SOOOOOOON]() if you want to find out what exact drops you can get.
