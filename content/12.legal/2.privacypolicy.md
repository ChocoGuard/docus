::alert{type="info"}
This page serves to educate ChocoGuard users about our policies concerning the gathering, utilization, and sharing of Personal Information in case anyone chooses to use ChocoGuard.

::list{type="info"}
- In summary, we don't collect a lot of data. We respect your privacy, and we don't employ Google Analytics. If you'd like more details, feel free to continue reading.

When you opt to use our Service, you are consenting to the gathering and utilization of information as outlined in this policy. The Personal Information we collect serves the purpose of enhancing and delivering the Service. Rest assured, we won't employ your information for any purposes beyond what's essential for operating the service or as demanded by legal requirements. (And honestly, I doubt the law has much interest in a bunch of numerical data with a unique identifier.)

The terms employed in this Privacy Policy adheres to the same definitions as those detailed in our Terms and Conditions, which you can access here. Unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the meanings remain consistent.



## Information Collection and Use of Data

We exclusively collect data that you willingly provide while using the bot. This doesn't apply to passive data collection methods like tracking levels or the number of times you've been claimed.

**Rest assured**, we store your data securely, and your **user identifier is your unique Discord user ID**, often referred to as a *"snowflake."*

If you ever want to double-check or if you believe we've overlooked something crucial, please feel free to review the source. If you find any gaps, you can reach out to us through the "contact us" section at the bottom of the page.



## Log Data

We may keep a record of the servers where our bot is in, primarily to aid in security. It's crucial to note that we do not gather any personal information, this information can be **deleted** at your **discretion and removed at any time**.



## Website

Our main website is remarkably simple, consisting solely of a static page with no code ([Source of site](https://vercel.com/templates/nuxt/docus) or [Github Source](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/docus)), except for the use of markdown. This straightforward approach guarantees that we do not employ any form of analytics, including Google's or any other contemporary tracking methods.

The same privacy-focused philosophy extends to our [Wiki Source](https://vercel.com/templates/nuxt/docus) or [Github Source](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/docus) which are completely devoid of any tracking mechanisms.

- It's worth mentioning that we do utilize Cloudflare analytics, but this is strictly for routing the page through Cloudflare to safeguard against DDOS attacks. This analytics feature does not compromise user privacy or gather personal data.

## Children's Privacy

Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13, and we do not intentionally collect "personally" identifiable information from children in this age group. If, by any chance, we become aware that a child under 13 has shared "personal" information with us, we promptly remove this data from our servers. If you are a **parent** or **guardian** and you discover that your child has furnished us with "personal" information, please reach out to us so that we can take appropriate measures.



## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Our Privacy Policy may undergo occasional updates, and we recommend that you revisit this page at regular intervals to stay informed about any alterations. In the event of any changes, we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on this page. These modifications take effect immediately upon being posted. Rest assured, we don't have any sinister intentions behind these updates â€“ it's primarily a legal necessity. So, no need to panic.
