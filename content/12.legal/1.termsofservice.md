## 1.0 - The bot and its Systems

### 1.1 - The Bot and Its Purpose
ChocoGuard, often referred to as "the bot," serves as a tool designed to enhance your Discord™ experience, making it more enjoyable and convenient. ChocoGuard functions within a Discord™ guild or server.

### 1.2 - Support
Support for ChocoGuard is exclusively available on the support server, and it operates on a 'first-come-first-serve' basis. Any attempts to seek support through other channels are not officially recognized.
Check: [Support Server](https://discord.gg/HmjcHweWR4) or use `/support`

### 1.3 - General Information
ChocoGuard is a free service provided without any guarantees. It's in the beta stage, which means it may have some bugs. Your understanding and patience in this regard are greatly appreciated.



## 2.0 - Use of the ChocoGuard Economy System

### 2.1 - Data
By using ChocoGuard commands that involve providing data, you agree that all information will be stored on a remote database indefinitely. This data is highly confidential and will not be used for any purpose other than the specific functionality of the bot. It will not be sold or shared.

### 2.2 - Usage and Cheating/Botting
Cheating and using bots (including self-bots, user-bots, macros, and auto-clickers on your account to gain an unfair advantage) are strictly prohibited. If caught cheating or botting in any currency-related commands, your profile is at high risk of complete deletion from the database without prior warning. [Please note that this violation may also result in a Discord ban, as it goes against Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

#### 2.2.1 - Macros
Keyboard macros are allowed if they perform only one command per keypress. For example, having a macro to execute `/beg` and then pressing enter is acceptable. However, running a macro that performs multiple commands with a single keypress, such as "claim daily -> enter -> claim weekly -> enter -> beg," is considered botting and is not allowed.

### 2.3 - Re-incidences
**Continued cheating on the games or currency commands will lead to the **termination of your account**, with all its **data deleted**, and a **blacklist** from using the bot.**

### 2.4 - Appeals
If you wish to be **Unblacklisted** from using the bot, you can submit a **full appeal** by sending an apology letter addressing the following points:

[Support Server](https://discord.gg/HmjcHweWR4) or use `/support`

## 3.1 - Economy Stock Command
In adherence to our Terms of Service, ChocoGuard explicitly discourages users from engaging in any form of Crypto Trading, Blockchain activities, or related endeavors. We want to emphasize the following:

### 3.1.2 - Prohibition of Crypto Trading:
ChocoGuard does not endorse or encourage users to participate in Crypto Trading, Blockchain transactions, or any associated activities.

### 3.1.2 - Fictional Stock Names:
Our platform refrains from using real-life Crypto names for our Stock Names. Any resemblance to actual cryptocurrencies is purely coincidental.

### 3.1.3 - Non-Implementation of Real-Life Trading Methods:
ChocoGuard does not implement or endorse any real-life trading methods. We operate independently and do not engage with any real-world trading APIs.

### 3.1.4 - Absence of API Connections:
**We want to make it clear that ChocoGuard is not connected to any real-world trading APIs. Our platform functions as a standalone entity without external trading integrations.**

## 3.2 - Snapshot Command

### 3.2.1 - Snapshot Command:
The `snapshot` command is designed to create a backup of essential server information. **This includes channels, categories, and important settings**. *It specifically excludes messages and member data*.

### 3.2.2 - Load Snapshot Command:
The `load_snapshot` command is intended to load a previously created server backup. It restores the channels, categories, and settings saved with the snapshot command. **It does not restore messages or member data**.

### 3.2.3 - Important Points:
#### Data Exclusion:
The snapshot feature intentionally excludes the storage of messages and member information. It is solely focused on preserving the structural and configurational aspects of the server.

### 3.2.4 - Command Usage:
Users are encouraged to use the `snapshot` command responsibly and only in compliance with Discord's Terms of Service. Backups should be created for legitimate purposes, such as safeguarding server configurations.

### 3.2.5 - Load Snapshot Responsibility:
The `load_snapshot` command should be **executed with care**. Loading a backup will **overwrite** the current server configuration with the saved snapshot, and any subsequent changes made after the snapshot creation will be lost.

### 3.2.6 - Snapshot ToS (Terms of Service) Compliance:
By using the `snapshot` and `load_snapshot` commands, users agree to comply with ChocoGuard's Terms of Service. Any misuse or violation of these commands may result in corrective actions, including but not limited to restricted access.

### 3.2.7 - Note:
**ChocoGuard is not responsible for the loss of data**, messages, or member information resulting from the use of the `snapshot` and `load_snapshot` commands. *Users are advised to use these commands responsibly and be aware of the potential consequences*.
