# Whois/User-Info

"Whois" typically refers to a command or feature that allows users to retrieve detailed information about a specific user within a Discord server or community. When you use this command, you can access information such as the user's username, nickname, user ID, avatar, and various other details.

This feature is often used for getting to know other users in a server, checking their roles and permissions, and identifying individual users quickly. It can be helpful for server administrators and moderators to manage user interactions and assist with various inquiries.
