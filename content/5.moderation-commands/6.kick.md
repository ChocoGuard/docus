# Kick

The Kick command empowers server administrators or moderators to remove a user from the server without a permanent ban. When a user is kicked, they are immediately ejected from the server, losing access to its channels and activities. However, unlike a ban, a kick is a temporary measure, and the user can rejoin the server at any time.

This command is often used for less severe infractions or as a warning, providing a way for administrators to address behavioral issues without resorting to a permanent ban. Kicking allows for swift and temporary removal, prompting the user to reassess their actions and behavior before rejoining the server.
