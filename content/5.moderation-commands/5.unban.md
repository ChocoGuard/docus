# Unban

The Unban command, enables server administrators or moderators to reverse a user's ban, restoring their access to the server. After being unbanned, the user can once again enter the server, send messages, and participate in various server activities. This command is utilized when the ban on a user is deemed unnecessary or if the user has addressed the issues that led to the ban, allowing them to rejoin the server community.
