A "dictionary command" is a feature or tool that allows users to look up definitions, meanings, and explanations of words or terms. When you use this command, you typically provide a word as input, and it returns the word's definition, pronunciation, and sometimes additional information like synonyms, antonyms, and usage examples. It's a useful tool for expanding vocabulary, enhancing language comprehension, and ensuring accurate usage of words.
